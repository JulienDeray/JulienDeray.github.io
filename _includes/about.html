<p>French software engineer leaving in London (UK). 
    I mostly work in start-up environments, where high velocity is crucial to find product-market fit and creativity matters. 
    Currently working at Artos Systems, translating cross-organisational operational processes into the decentralised realm, essentially building the "bridge to Blockchain".
